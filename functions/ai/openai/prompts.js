  Task: Create JSON_caracters_update_list, a list that updates and expands the existing JSON_characters_list based on the novel's text excerpt CSV_chapter_text.

  Procedure:
  
  1. Input Analysis:
  - You will receive a text excerpt in CSV format (CSV_chapter_text). Each row having a "text" key (chapter text) and a "startTime" key (time in seconds when the text is narrated).
  2. Existing Characters Update:
  - For each Character already listed in JSON_characters_list, review CSV_chapter_text for any new aliases or names.
  - Update the existing character entries with these aliases, ensuring there is only one object per individual character.
  - Do your best to add aliases to characters instead of adding new ones.
  3. New Characters Addition:
  - Identify and list any new characters mentioned in CSV_chapter_text that are not in JSON_characters_list, and not an alias of another character.
  - Ensure new characters are not duplicates of existing characters, or aliases of another character.
  - For each new character, create a new object including:
  --The most commonly used name in the text (or a descriptive reference if no name is provided).
  --The startTime of their first mention in the text.
  --A newly generated unique ID.
  4. Main Name Modification:
  - Modify the mainName attribute for a character only if a more proper name is used in the text.
  5. Inclusions and Exclusions:
  - Focus exclusively on characters. Avoid references to locations, objects, things, or characteristics.
  - Include every character mentioned, regardless of its significance in the text.
  - Ensure all aliases, significant or not, are added to the character objects.
  - Add no duplicates. Do not add a character if it exists already in JSON_characters_list.
  6. Data Integrity:
  - Maintain one object per individual character. Avoid creating multiple entries for the same character.
  - Do not remove any character from JSON_characters_list, even if it isn't mentioned in CSV_chapter_text.
  - Don't feel forced to update an entry. It is okay to leave many entries unchanged.
  - Only include an entry in JSON_characters_update_list if it has been updated or added.
  
  Goal: The final output should be a comprehensive and detailed JSON_characters_update_list that accurately reflects all character-related information from CSV_chapter_text.

6,36.74,"Madame went on with her knitting and took no notice. "
7,40.58,"Mr Jarvis Lorry (the gentleman) and Miss Lucie Manette joined Defarge in the courtyard to which he had recently directed the three men. In the courtyard Defarge did a surprising thing. He went down on one knee and put his lips to the young lady's hand. "
8,44.3," Defarge at one time had been a servant of Dr Manette, Lucies father. Lucie's mother had died, and her father had disappeared: no one knew what had happened to him. His money was in Tellsons Bank â€” an English bank. The baby Lucie was brought to England, and Mr Jarvis Lorry, an official of Tellson's Bank and an old friend of her father's, was put in charge of her money and her education. Mr Lorry had asked an Englishwoman, Miss Pross, to bring up the child. Over the years that followed, Miss Pross became like a mother to Lucie and would have given her fife for her."

The following is a text excerpt of a novel CSV_chapter_text, as well as a JSON_chracters_list object of some characters in the novel.
The excerpt is in JSON form, with each row containing a "text" key of the chapter text, and 
 a startTime containing the time in seconds when the narrator the text.
Your goal is to read the entire text, and augment JSON_characters_properties. JSON_characters_properties provides a physical description of each character.
If any of the chapter text describes a characeter, add a new object to the JSON_characters_properties array.
This will outline a character, a relationship, a property, and a time. The relationship is the relationship between the character and the
property. The property is a phyiscal property of the character. The time is the "startTime" of the text that provided the relationship.
These relationships will be used in a neo4j graph database to be able to accurately describe the physical characteristics of each character. 
Do not add emotional or psychological characteristics. Only add physical characteristics.

There is no limit to the number of relationships or properties that can be provided. 
It is imperative to be comprehensive. Leave no detail out.

scene object for each scene in the chapter. A scene object is:
  a "scene_number" increasing one by one
  a "description" of the scene, which is very detailed and outlines exactly what is happening. Take a lot of the text from the chapter and insert it here.
  a "startTime" of the scene, based on the start_time of the sentences in the csv file the scene captures
  a "character" array of characters in the scene
  a "locations" array of locations in the scene
  a "viewpoint" {
  "setting": "time of day and lightning of the scene",
  "placement": "Placement of characters or other points of focus",
  "shot type: "wide, medium or close-up shot, camera angle",
  "mood": "mood of the scene",
  "technical": "lens choices and aperture settings"
  }

Only refer to characters by their name from the Character List.
Only refer to locations by their name from the Locations List.

You must create enough scenes to cover the entire chapter. Many scenes can be of the same description but
from a different viewpoint. 
Generate a scene at least every 15 seconds, and at most every 5 seconds.

  `,
  character_description_full_text: `
You will be provided with the full text of a novel and asked to describe %CHARACTER%'s physical characteristics. Your task is to provide an accurate and detailed description that can be used by a diffusion model to depict %CHARACTER% visually.
Please follow these instructions carefully:
1. Read through the novel text and identify all mentions and descriptions of %CHARACTER%.
2. Focus solely on the physical characteristics of the character. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Clothing
   - Hair (color, style, length)
   - Gender
   - Race or ethnicity
   - Age or apparent age
   - Height and build
   - Facial features
   - Any distinguishing marks or characteristics
3. At a minimum, you must include descriptions of the character's clothing, hair, gender, age and race. If these details are not explicitly stated in the text, make an educated guess based on context clues or the setting of the novel. Don't be afraid to guess a race.
4. Be as descriptive and specific as possible. Instead of saying "he wore a shirt," specify the type, color, and style of the shirt if that information is available or can be reasonably inferred.
5. If you need to make educated guesses about any characteristics, base them on context clues from the novel, such as the time period, location, or social status of the character. Don't explain your guesses, just state them factually.
6. Avoid including personality traits, background information, or plot details unless they directly relate to the character's physical appearance.
7. Structure your description in a way that flows logically, such as starting with overall appearance and moving to specific details.
8. Write your description in a way that would be helpful for a diffusion model to create an accurate visual representation of the character.
  `,
  location_description_full_text: `
You will be provided with the full text of a novel and asked to describe a specific location mentioned in the story. Your task is to create an accurate and vivid description of this location that could be used by a diffusion model to generate an image.

The location you need to describe is:
%LOCATION%

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the novel text, paying special attention to any mentions or descriptions of %LOCATION%

2. Identify all relevant details about %LOCATION%, including:
   - Physical characteristics (size, shape, color, etc.)
   - Atmosphere or mood
   - Time period or historical context
   - Any significant objects or features within the location
   - Sensory details (sights, sounds, smells, textures)

3. Synthesize these details into a coherent and vivid description. Your description should:
   - Be as accurate to the novel's portrayal as possible
   - Provide enough detail for a diffusion model to generate an accurate image
   - Capture the essence and mood of the location

4. Ensure your description is appropriate for all audiences:
   - Omit any graphic violence, explicit sexual content, or other inappropriate details
   - Focus on elements that would not trigger content filtering issues

5. Write your final description and aim for a paragraph of 4-6 sentences that paints a clear picture of the location.

Remember, your goal is to create a description that is both faithful to the novel and suitable for image generation. Be descriptive and evocative, but avoid any content that could be deemed inappropriate or offensive.
